# Coffee machine

As a user I want to be able to select a coffee type and make it.

Coffee machine could be configured to accept different coffee recipes:
- Espresso: 7g coffee beans, 37 ml water
- Latte: 7g coffee beans, 37 ml water, 170 ml milk
- Americano: 7g coffee beans, 100 ml water

=====================================

- Feature #1: 
  - Coffee machine should be able to make an espresso. 
  - A coffee with the correct ingredients is expected as a result of coffee machine work.
  - Ingredient is a value (7) + unit (g) = 7g
  - There is only one coffee machine which makes different coffee types

- Feature #2:
  - ...

=====================================
- Feel free to use any architecture, patterns, good practices you like
- The goal is not only to make the code that works but also the code which is 
  - maintainable
  - easy to read, simple
  - clean
- ≈45min for the first feature
