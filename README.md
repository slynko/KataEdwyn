# Coffee machine

As a user I want to be able to select a coffee type and make it.

Coffee machine could be configured to accept different coffee recipes:
- Espresso = 100% Espresso
- Latte = 30% Espresso, 70% Milk
- Americano = 30% Espresso, 70% Water

=====================================

- Feature #1: 
  - Coffee machine should be able to make an espresso
    - Subtask #1:  

- Feature #2: 
  - Coffee machine should be able to switch between coffee recipes (Espresso, Latte, Americano)
